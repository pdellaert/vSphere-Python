multi-clone.py
==============
multi-clone is a Python script which allows you to clone a virtual machine or virtual machine template into multiple new virtual machines in a VMware vSphere environment.

This script has the following capabilities:
* Deploy a specified amount of virtual machines
* Deploy in a specified datacenter
* Deploy in a specified cluster
* Deploy in a specified datastore
* Deploy in a specified folder
* Deploy in a specified resource pool
* Set advanced configuration options
* Specify if the cloned virtual machines need to be powered on
* Print out information of the main network interface (mac and ip, either IPv4 or IPv6)
* Run a post-processing script with 3 parameters (virtual machine name, mac and ip)
* Instead of setting the basename, amount, resource pool and folder a CSV can be used
* Print logging to a log file or stdout
* Do this in a threaded way
* Use Linked Clones to speed up cloning

### Using threads ###
Deciding on the optimal amount of threads might need a bit of experimentation. Keep certain things in mind:
* The optimal amount of threads depends on the IOPS of the datastore as each thread will start a template deployment task, which in turn starts copying the disks.
* vCenter will, by default, only run 8 deployment tasks simultaniously while other tasks are queued, so setting the amount of threads to more than 8, is not really usefull.

### Using CSV file ###
A CSV file can be provided with a line for each VM that needs to be created, with specific parameters for each VM. The format of each row should be (fields surrounded without [] are mandatory, fields surrounded with [] are optional):
```
    "<Clone name>";"[Datacenter]";"[Cluster]";"[Resouce Pool]";"[Folder]";"[Datastore]";"[MAC Address]";"[Post-processing Script]";"[Advanced VM Parameters in JSON format]"
```
For instance:
```
    "Test01";"New-York";"Compute-Cluster-01";"Development";"IT";"VSAN-DS";"00:50:56:11:11:11";"run.sh";"{""parameter.1"":""value.1"",""parameter.2"":""value.2""}"
```
### Post-processing Script ###
The Post-processing script is run for each VM created if it is provided either as a commandline parameter or as a field in the CSV.
It is run with the following parameters:
* virtual machine name, mac and ip : If Print IPs or Print MACs is enabled, combined with Power on
* virtual machine name, mac: If a custom mac address was specified (even if VM is not powered on)
* virtual machine name: If a power on is disabled and no custom mac address is enabled

### Usage ###
        usage: multi-clone.py [-h] [-6] [-b BASENAME] [-c COUNT] [-C CSVFILE]
                              [--cluster CLUSTER] [-d] [--datacenter DATACENTER]
                              [--datastore DATASTORE] [--folder FOLDER] -H HOST [-i]
                              [-m] [-l LOGFILE] [-L] [--snapshot SNAPSHOT] [-n AMOUNT]
                              [-o PORT] [-p PASSWORD] [-P]
                              [--resource-pool RESOURCE_POOL] [-s POST_SCRIPT] [-S] -t
                              TEMPLATE [-T THREADS] -u USERNAME [-v] [-w MAXWAIT]
        
        Deploy a template into multiple VM's. You can get information returned with
        the name of the virtual machine created and it's main mac and ip address.
        Either in IPv4 or IPv6 format. You can specify which folder and/or resource
        pool the clone should be placed in. Verbose and debug output can either be
        send to stdout, or saved to a log file. A post-script can be specified for
        post-processing. And it can all be done in a number of parallel threads you
        specify. The script also provides the ability to use a CSV for a lot of it
        settings and if you want to specify the mac address of the clones (usefull for
        DHCP/PXE configuration).
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -6, --six             Get IPv6 address for VMs instead of IPv4
          -b BASENAME, --basename BASENAME
                                Basename of the newly deployed VMs
          -c COUNT, --count COUNT
                                Starting count, the name of the first VM deployed will
                                be <basename>-<count>, the second will be
                                <basename>-<count+1> (default = 1)
          -C CSVFILE, --csv CSVFILE
                                An optional CSV overwritting the basename and count.
                                For each line, a clone will be created. A line consits
                                of the following fields, fields inside <> are
                                mandatory, fields with [] are not: "<Clone
                                name>";"[Datacenter]";"[Cluster]";"[Resouce
                                Pool]";"[Folder]";"[Datastore]";"[MAC Address
